### **🎨 What You Can Do Now:**

#### **1. Upload Maya's Image → Real AI Analysis**
```
📤 Upload character image → 👁️ OpenAI Vision analyzes → 📋 Real character profile
- Actual hair color, eye color, age detection
- Real art style analysis (manga/anime/realistic)  
- Detailed character description for consistency
```

#### **2. Generate Story → Real AI Images**
```
📖 Story generation → 🎨 DALL-E 3 creates images → 💾 Real images saved locally
- Maya appears consistently across all pages
- Real AI-generated character-consistent images
- Images stored in backend/generated-images/
```

#### **3. Character Consistency in Action**
```
Story: "Maya reads a book in the library"
→ DALL-E 3 generates: Maya (with her exact features) reading in library setting
